        Arguments:
            set_to_none (bool): instead of setting to zero, set the grads to None.
                This is will in general have lower memory footprint, and can modestly improve performance.
                However, it changes certain behaviors. For example:
                1. When the user tries to access a gradient and perform manual ops on it,
                a None attribute or a Tensor full of 0s will behave differently.
                2. If the user requests ``zero_grad(set_to_none=True)`` followed by a backward pass, ``.grad``\ s
                are guaranteed to be None for params that did not receive a gradient.
                3. ``torch.optim`` optimizers have a different behavior if the gradient is 0 or None
                (in one case it does the step with a gradient of 0 and in the other it skips
                the step altogether).
